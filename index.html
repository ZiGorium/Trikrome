<h1 id="the-dark">The Dark</h1>
<p>This Potfa as a game needs a few elements before it can even be
considered in Alpha, and the main one is light and dark.</p>
<p>My current Goals to get the game into Alpha are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Combat</strong></p>
<p>  currently as things stand, combat amounts to enemy creatures
walking up to the player and hitting him. Though rather than reduce the
player’s health, they just get teleported a small distance
away.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Creature pathing</strong></p>
<p>  Pathing is basic, but functional at the moment. Though I will be
adding memory based mechanics, where they will travel to the last known
spot, rather than just standing still the moment the player is no longer
in view. But this will be tricky, as the creature might have to mark
their most recent memory with some way of denoting the memory has been
investigated, so that they don’t get stuck investigating a memory
forever.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>
<p>  Easier said than done, and in all honesty can make or break this
little project. I’ve only looked into this a little. Shadow casting is
the most appealing option currently. But that might change depending on
whether I find some better algorithms for light propagation and
whatnot.</p>
<p>My hopes for lighting is mainly, Colored lights, moving light sources
and Good FPS even with a lot of light sources.</p>
<p>Though this will be the largest challenge Potfa has had so far,
Lighting could steal a good 250 to 300 FPS. Which is not good. I’m
already down to only 350 ~ 200 range, though it’s not exact.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inventories / UI</strong></p>
<p>  This one is going to be another big challenge. But more tedious
than anything, the current state of the game could do with some
inventory and hover identification.</p>
<p>hoping I can get drag and drop inventory functionality, and maybe
mouse hover to work.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Possible game, App on the Iphone. Papas pizziaria + Factorio +
physics game!</p>
<p>take in unprocessed materials. Process them, refine them, and ship
them out, paid for the work or to be sold.</p>
<p>hoping it makes me some money. we’ll see i guess.</p>

<h1 id="second-test-post">Second Test Post</h1>
<p>This is to test and see if the github action / workflow can even see
files getting pushed to the md_posts/** area if not… we have some work
to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Item 1 Git the website working</li>
<li>Item 2 Set up the lambda function -Item 3 Set up a ec2 instance to
run my docker images -Item 4 Get lambda to poll the Docker nexus for
data and send it to the website -Item 5 get the website to graphically
display the data in a pleasing way, with a nice little menu to paruse
the different worlds.</li>

<p>Potfa as a whole is making steady progress.</p>
<p>soon creatures will not be able to see each other through walls. as
things are, currently the graphics are fine, but creature abillities are
lacking. also im planning on making vegetation grow, though not sure if
it will be visual to the player or not. still thinking baout whether or
not to add hunger to the player or creatures. also thinking about adding
farming with livestock as well!!!</p>
<p>Things Id also like to implement would be light based mechanics, and
where territory expands with the light plans you plant.</p>
<p>My current goals for the upcoming Alpha are: -Inventory -Harvestnig
-Crafting -Death drops</p>

<p>Just added line of sight, builings have collsion, and montser can
path towards the player when he is in view. great stuffs</p>
<p>sadly, there are a few bugs but those will get worked out eventually
as awlays.</p>
<p>planning on adding plants soon so we can actually have some gameplay
going. as currently the game is just a running simulator.</p>
