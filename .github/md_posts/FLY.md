# In the Works


As things stand, this is more or less the start of things officially. This year I have a few Goals I wish to accomplish for this company. For one, putting in a request with the State of Texas to officially file as a business under the Name Trikrome, maybe get a logo and trademark registered as well.


- **Games**  
  
    &nbsp;&nbsp; This year, im going to push Pilgrim of the Fifth Apocalypse to its Alpha. Now, this probably wont include multiplayer, but in all honesty I might just make the very next feature to work on before i start anything else for that project. Multiplayer will take a considerable amount of planning for it to meet my expectations and standards for the vision I have. Seamless world traveling, little to no load times, little to no delay. These aren't exactly synonymous with realtime multiplayer games, but it *is* possible. It just takes a little hard work and intentionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;

    Now, Potfa's Goals more or less should have been listed elsewhere, and I will probably do a post do better clarify its goals and what it aims to actually acomplish as a Game. But for now, I will be focusing on the lighting portion of the engine, and a few refactors to the file structure ive been putting off for the better part of a year now...

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    The next thing is Phyzik Factory and Netimals. Both of these games, in all honesty, have a higher chance at commercial success than potfa, and as such I will be trying to focus these down to completion, preferably Phyzik Factory first. I would like that to be my first professional release of a Game. Its got a strong premise, good eye catching power, and most importantly of all. Its got good prospects for Tik tok viewing. I think the potential for being viral is pretty good as well.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;

    Netimals is another matter. A live streamed 24/7 virtual pet. Chatters can interact and donate to get reactions or move the pet from zone to zone. Just a cash flow Idea to bring in some extra income to fund the other projects. And grow the channel presence of the studio. Which in turn will help the other games. I have good expectations for Netimals, but ill have to be done with phyzik factory before I can move to that. Which will take some time...

- **Trikrome**  
  
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Another Goal is to launch trikrome, this isnt really all that important now, but at some point Legal mumbo jumbo will kick in and ill need some sort of shield, which is a huge benefit of having a llc, and not running something personally.




- **Final Notes**
    &nbsp;&nbsp; with these things in mind, I think its going to be a productive year. Potfa should hit Alpha, Phyzik Factory either will be launched or at minimum get to pre launch beta. Get some planning for Netimals layed down. And honestly not much else. It will be a quiet year for me, If everything goes awesome, in 2027 ill have Phyzik factory fully ready and launched on the appstore, and lots of tik-tok / Youtube shorts adds out there to spread the word. Other than that, theres not much to say. Good luck out there, and thanks for the support.
