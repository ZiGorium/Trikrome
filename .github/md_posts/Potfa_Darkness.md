# The Dark


This Potfa as a game needs a few elements before it can even be considered in Alpha, and the main one is light and dark.  

My current Goals to get the game into Alpha are:


- Combat  
    currently as things stand, combat amounts to enemy creatures walking up to the player and hitting him. Though rather than reduce the player's health, they just get teleported a small distance away.
- Creature pathing  
    Pathing is basic, but functional at the moment. Though I will be adding memory based mechanics, where they will travel to the last known spot, rather than just standing still the moment the player is no longer in view. But this will be tricky, as the creature might have to mark their most recent memory with some way of denoting the memory has been investigated, so that they don't get stuck investigating a memory forever.
- Lighting  
    Easier said than done, and in all honesty can make or break this little project. I've only looked into this a little. Shadow casting is the most appealing option currently. But that might change depending on whether I find some better algorithms for light propagation and whatnot.  

    My hopes for lighting is mainly, Colored lights, moving light sources and Good FPS even with a lot of light sources.  

    Though this will be the largest challenge Potfa has had so far, Lighting could steal a good 250 to 300 FPS. Which is not good. I'm already down to only 350 ~ 200 range, though it's not exact.  
- Inventories / UI  
    This one is going to be another big challenge. But more tedious than anything, the current state of the game could do with some inventory and hover identification.  

    hoping I can get drag and drop inventory functionality, and maybe mouse hover to work.
