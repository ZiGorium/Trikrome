<p>Potfa as a whole is making steady progress.</p>
<p>soon creatures will not be able to see each other through walls. as
things are, currently the graphics are fine, but creature abillities are
lacking. also im planning on making vegetation grow, though not sure if
it will be visual to the player or not.</p>
<p>My current goals for the upcoming Alpha are: -Inventory -Harvestnig
-Crafting -Death drops</p>
